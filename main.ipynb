      "\"There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:\"\n",
      "\"that is, the old duke is banished by his younger\"\n",
      "\"brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords\"\n",
      "\"have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,\"\n",
      "\"whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;\"\n",

      "\"Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be\"\n",
      "\"banished with her father?\"\n",
      "\"O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves\"\n",
      "\"her, being ever from their cradles bred together,\"\n",
      "\"that she would have followed her exile, or have died\"\n",
      "\"to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no\"\n",
      "\"less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and\"\n",
      "\"never two ladies loved as they do.\"\n",
      "\"Where will the old duke live?\"\n",
      "\"They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and\"\n",
      "\"a many merry men with him; and there they live like\"\n",
      "\"the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young\"\n",
      "\"gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time\"\n",
      "\"carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\"\n",
      "\"What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?\"\n",
      "\"Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a\"\n",

      "\"To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that\"\n",

      "\"for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I\"\n",
      "\"must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,\"\n",
      "\"out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you\"\n",
      "\"withal, that either you might stay him from his\"\n",
      "\"intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall\"\n",
      "\"run into, in that it is a thing of his own search\"\n",
      "\"and altogether against my will.\"\n",
      "\"Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which\"\n",

      "\"myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and\"\n",
      "\"have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from\"\n",
      "\"it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:\"\n",
      "\"it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full\"\n",
      "\"of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's\"\n",
      "\"good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against\"\n",
      "\"me his natural brother: therefore use thy\"\n",
      "\"discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck\"\n",
      "\"as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if\"\n",
      "\"thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not\"\n",
      "\"mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise\"\n",
      "\"against thee by poison, entrap thee by some\"\n",

      "\"for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak\"\n",
      "\"it, there is not one so young and so villanous this\"\n",

      "\"should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must\"\n",
      "\"blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.\"\n",
      "\"I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come\"\n",

      "\"Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see\"\n",

      "\"if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously\"\n",
      "\"tempered as mine is to thee.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to\"\n",

      "\"before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.\"\n",
      "\"Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?\"\n",
      "\"One that old Frederick, your father, loves.\"\n",
